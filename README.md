# sp500ReturnGraph
Calculating Total Return of S&amp;P 500 index from 1990 to 2022

In this script I have used python with pandas and the matplotlib library 

--Pandas is used to read data from the excel file. We then process the data to find Total return using the formula in excel sheet(t = %DailyReturn +1; y = (product of all previous entries t) -1)*100

--matplotlib produces a line graph in an interactive window where users can zoom in/out, restrict the axes size etc..
